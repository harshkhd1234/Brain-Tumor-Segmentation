# Brain Tumor Sgmentation

# Problem Statement :
A Neurologist uses many test to locate or diagnose a brain tumor. Several tests may be conducted to identify if tumor has spread to any other part of body from where it started. This is rare in case of brain tumor. One of the difficulty arises for a Radiologist or Neurologist while analyzing imaging tests for MRI scans i.e to differentiate healthy tissue from tumorous tissues. The dataset used is BRATS-2015 containing 3D images but images are converted in 2D images using „DICOM converter‟ tool and are considered for this experimentation. The proposed method is to use UNET model for proper segmentation of tumor from healthy tissues. Due to unpredictable shape or place of appearance, segmenting brain tumors from imaging data is one of the most challenging tasks in medical image analysis.

# Solution : 
As a solution to the proposed problem, we designed our own model of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which can be integrated into the system working along hi-tech camera and sensors to provide better judgement and recognition of traffic signs. 

Our concern is to provide solution to such a problem which haven’t been acknowledged by many others. Our model will promote smooth and safe conduct of traffic with lesser traffic disturbances and road mishaps. In layman's term, our work is a contribution in uplifting the concept of already existing Self driving cars, by adding some extensions in its model. The car will alert the drivers about the nearby traffic signs and help in maintaining a healthy road presence.

In addition to all the above points, the inexperienced drivers who don’t know much about traffic signs won’t feel unconfident and will be getting guidance on the go!!
